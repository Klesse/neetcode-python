This repository contains the solutions for the leetcode's problems structured 
in neetcode roadmap.

This roadmap was made by neetcode to be a learn structured path for who wants 
to train DSA and do interview questions at leetcode. With this path 
you increase your ability in DSA in a logical order.

The roadmap approaches simple to advanced data structure's problems (linked 
list, graphs, heaps, etc.) and algorithms in general (hashing, DP, backtracking, 
etc.)
